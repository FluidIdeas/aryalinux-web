<h4>Installing Google Chrome on AryaLinux</h4>
<p>
Google Chrome browser is one of the few applications that gets installed in AryaLinux via binaries.
The buildscript for google-chrome, downloads the latest debian binary and installs extracts and installs it.
This can be a hit or a miss because a package not build on AryaLinux may or may not work on AryaLinux so
this cannot be relied on and its better to use Firefox. Compiling the source code of chromium browser
(the base for Google Chrome) as such takes a very long time to build and installing Chrome using binaries saves
the time.

The package that needs to be installed to install Chrome is google-chrome.
Run the following command to install Chrome:
