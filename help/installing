<h4>System Requirements</h4>
<p>
The minimum system requirements to run AryaLinux are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>RAM: 2GB</li>
    <li>Hard Disk space: 15GB</li>
    <li>Processor: 3rd generation Intel i3 Processor</li>
    <li>USB port or DVD Drive</li>
    <li>Resolution: 1366x768</li>
</ul>
<p>
While the above requirements are sufficient to run AryaLinux, you may not
get optimum performance by running AryaLinux on a system with the above
configuration. We have tested AryaLinux on systems with the above configuration
and it works. Systems with configuration better than that mentioned above
would surely run AryaLinux better. Here are the recommended specifications to
get a very good performance:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>RAM: 8GB</li>
    <li>Hard Disk space: 200GB</li>
    <li>Processor: Latest Intel or AMD Processor</li>
    <li>USB port or DVD Drive</li>
    <li>Resolution: 1920x1080</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downloading and Preparing the live media for booting</h4>
<p>
AryaLinux is available with various desktop environment options like KDE, Gnome3, XFCE
and Mate. You can download the ISO of the desktop environment you want to install from
the <a href="downloads.php">downloads section</a>. Once the ISO file is downloaded, you
can either burn the ISO into a DVD or write it into a pen drive. There are several
software that can help you do that. If you are in Windows, then you can use
<a href="https://unetbootin.github.io/">Unetbootin</a>. Unetbootin is available for Linux
as well. If you are on Linux, you can also use the dd command to write the ISO into the
Pen Drive. The dd command is for advanced users and one should exercise caution while
executing this command:
</p>
<pre>
dd if=/path/to/aryalinux-iso-file of=/dev/sdx status=progress bs=10M oflag=sync
</pre>
<p>
Please replace <b>/path/to/aryalinux-iso-file</b> in the command above with the
path to the AryaLinux ISO file you downloaded earlier and <b>/dev/sdx</b> with
the USB device where you want to install AryaLinux. You may use the fdisk command
to get a list of the devices in the system.

<h4>Booting</h4>
<p>
Once the boot media is prepared, you can boot into AryaLinux by choosing the boot
media prepared in the above step from the BIOS boot menu. If your hard disk is
formatted has a MBR or MSDOS type partition, then please <b><i>dont</i></b> boot
into the boot media in the UEFI mode. In case the hard disk has a GPT partition type
then boot in UEFI mode. Please make sure you boot into the right mode and you have
the right partition type as mentioned above otherwise AryaLinux would not install.

<h4>Running the Installer</h4>
<p>
Once you have boot into the live media, you can run AryaLinux installer to install
the OS into the hard disk. AryaLinux's installer is different from the installers
of other Linux distributions but the questions that are asked by the installer are
nearly the same. We are working on making the Installer more user friendly and you
would see improvements with time. <a href="documentation.php?article=aryalinux-doc#2">
Here</a> are the instructions on how to use the installer.
