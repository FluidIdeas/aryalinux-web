<h4>Installing NVidia graphics on AryaLinux</h4>
<p>
The installation of NVidia graphics driver on AryaLinux is a little tricky. In brief
this is what it means:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>You need to be running a Linux kernel with Nouveau and NVidia graphics and framebuffer disabled</li>
    <li>You need to have the kernel headers installed in the right location</li>
    <li>You need not be running the X-Server while the installer is running.</li>
</ul>
<p>
While its tricky its not difficult to install the NVidia graphics drivers on AryaLinux. The steps to install
NVidia graphics on AryaLinux are presented here:
</p>
<b>Download and install the NVidia supporting kernel and kernel headers</b>
<p>
Download the NVidia supporting kernel by running the following command:
</p>
<pre>
alps install nvidia-kernel kernel-headers
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
</pre>
<b>Download NVidia drivers</b>
<p>
Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.in/Download/index.aspx">https://www.nvidia.in/Download/index.aspx</a> and
download NVidia drivers. You have to select the product type, category etc and for the Operating System,
choose Linux 64-bit. Once the driver is downloaded, go ahead and give execute permissions to the file, for
example:
</p>
<pre>
chmod a+x /path/to/the/NVidia-Driver.run
</pre>
<b>Boot into the new kernel and disable lightdm</b>
<p>
Reboot and choose the NVidia supporting kernel from the Grub OS Selection menu. After you get to the desktop
open up a terminal and run the following command to disable the X-Server.
</p>
<pre>
sudo systemctl disable lightdm
</pre>
<p>
Then reboot the system. This time when the system would reboot, it would reboot into the text console. Log into
the text console by providing the username and password and once in the text console, run the command to execute
the driver installer.
</p>
<b>Install the NVidia driver</b>
<p>
Install the driver by running the following command:
</p>
<pre>
sudo /path/to/the/NVidia-Driver.run
</pre>
<p>
Once the driver installation is done, press the enter key twice to exit out of the installer. Then go ahead and
enable X-Server before rebooting:
</p>
<pre>
sudo systemctl enable lightdm
reboot
</pre>
<p>
In the Grub menu, choose the NVidia kernel and you can log into the system. This time the NVidia driver would be
running.
