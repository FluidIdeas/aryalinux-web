                Software Architect with 15 years of experience writing software in various technologies
                ranging from Python and Ruby to Spring Boot and Scala. I got introduced into the Open
                Source world in 2002 and it was love at first sight. Started my Linux journey with
                Red Hat Linux(much before it became Fedora) and then switched over to Ubuntu in 2006.
                In 2007, read Linux from Scratch and every since <a target="_blank" href="http://linuxfromscratch.org">LFS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://linuxfromscratch.org/blfs">BLFS</a> have been the way of life.

                <i>Building and Maintaining a distribution is a task that needs massive efforts and despite
                the team being a one man show, it would be great to have more helping hands. If you would
                like to join the development of AryaLinux and contribute in any way - development,
                translation or testing, drop in an email at <a href="mailto:aryalinux11@gmail.com">aryalinux11@gmail.com</a>.</i>
