<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
Remastering is the process of building your own Linux system by modifiying
some other Linux and you can remaster AryaLinux as well to create your own
system. Since applications cannot be uninstalled from AryaLinux, we provide
slim backups of AryaLinux on top which customizations can be done and packages
installed and remastering can be done.

<h4>Downloading the base tarball for remastering</h4>
<p>
You can download base tarballs from the <a href="downloads.php">download section</a>.
You can download the following base tarballs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Base System: The base system is the most mimimal version of AryaLinux. The base system
backup is a backup of AryaLinux root filesystem without X-Server and Desktop Enironment.
</li>
<li>
Base System with X-Server: This backup has X-Server on top of the base system. One can
use this backup to install any desktop environment on top of the X-Server. Sometimes
even the slimmest desktop environments can be heavy for the needs of some users. For
building such systems this backup can be used.
</li>
<li>
Base system with desktop environment: If you do not want the applications we ship with
AryaLinux, then you can use this backup and install the applications of your choice
on top of it. This backup just contains the dekstop environment and very few applications.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All the above backups have alps installed so that you can install the application of your
choice on it.

<h4>Getting the build tools</h4>
<p>
Once you download the backup tarball, you need to download the build tools. You can clone
the build tools repository by running the following command from the terminal. Please run
the command as a root user so that you have sufficient permissions to remaster.
</p>
<pre>
sudo su
git clone https://bitbucket.org/chandrakantsingh/aryalinux
cd aryalinux/base-system
</pre>

<h4>Restoring backup, chrooting and installing applications</h4>
<p>
You need to have an empty partition of size at least 20GB to restore the backup. Though
AryaLinux gets installed in much smaller partitions, the extra space would be used to
download and build packages. The partition should be formatted using ext4 filesystem.
Run the following commands to prepare the target partition:
</p>
<pre>
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdxx
</pre>
<p>
In the above command, please replace <b>sdxx</b> with the partition which you want to
format. Now mount the partition and restore the backup.
</p>
<pre>
mkdir -pv /mnt/lfs
mount /dev/sdxx /mnt/lfs
sudo tar xf /path/to/the/backup/tarball -C /
</pre>
<p>
This would extract the tarball into the /mnt/lfs directory where the target partition is
extracted. Once the tarball is extracted, you can chroot into the target partition by
running the following commands. Before chrooting however some preparation needs to be done.
Please substitue /dev/sdxx with the target partition. Run the following commands to prepare
the target system and chroot into it:
</p>
<pre>
mkdir /mnt/lfs/sources
ln -svf /mnt/lfs/sources /sources
cat &gt; build-properties&lt;&lt;EOF
LFS=/mnt/lfs
ROOT_PART=/dev/sdxx
EOF
cp -r * /sources/
cp -v build-properties /sources/
pushd /sources
wget http://aryalinux.info/files/build-log
echo 7 &gt; currentstage
popd
</pre>
<p>
Now you can chroot into restored AryaLinux so that you can customize the rest of the system.
</p>
<pre>
./enteral.sh
</pre>
<p>
Now you can install applications using alps and make changes in the chrooted system. Once the
changes are made you can exit out of the chrooted system by entering the exit command till you
are back to the base-system directory. Once you are back to the base-system directory, you can
either build a live ISO out of it or you can add an option to grub to show this new system in
the boot menu. Run the following command to build an ISO:
</p>
<pre>
cat &gt;&gt; build-properties &lt;&lt;EOF
INSTALL_BOOTLOADER=n
CREATE_LIVE_ISO=y
EOF
</pre>
<div style="text-align: right"><a href="#top">Top</a></div>
<a name="5"></a>
<h4>Building the ISO</h4>
<p>
Run the following command to start the ISO building process.
</p>
<pre>
./build-arya
</pre>
<p>
You would be prompted if you want to start from the beginning or resume build. Enter 2 as option.
Then you would be prompted to enter the name of the partition where build is being done. Enter
/dev/sdxx in response. Please change <b>/dev/sdxx</b> to the name of the partition where you
restored the system.
