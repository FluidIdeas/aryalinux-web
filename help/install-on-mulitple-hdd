<h4>The Issue</h4>
<p>
When you try installing AryaLinux on a system with multiple hard disks it fails.
</p>

<h4>The Cause</h4>
<p>
This is because of a glitch in the installer which does not take into account the
fact that there can multiple hard disks connected to the system. It so happens that
while installing AryaLinux on systems with a gpt type partition, the installer needs
to find out the EFI partition and the piece of bash script that tries finding out
the UUID of the EFI partition fails when there are multiple hard disks.

<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
The issue has been fixed. All you need to do is patch the installer in the Live
system with the fix in our development server. In simpler terms, once you boot
into the Live system, connect to the internet and run the following commands from
the terminal:
</p>
<pre>
cd /opt/installer-new
sudo git pull
</pre>
<p>
Now go ahead and run the installer again and it should work fine this time.
