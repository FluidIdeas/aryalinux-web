<h4>Installing Java</h4>
<p>
The Java programming language is a widely used programming language used by developers accross
the world and by Enterprises and Organizations alike. The original Java programming language
developed by Sun Microsystems is an Oracle property now and hence in order to install Oracle JDK,
you need to download Oracle JDK from Oracle's website and follow <a target="_blank" href="https://www.javahelps.com/2017/09/install-oracle-jdk-9-on-linux.html">this</a> article to
install the downloaded binary. <b>Please avoid step 7 and step 8 because they are Ubuntu specific commands.</b>
You need to accept the Oracle Java's License Agreement before you download Oracle's JDK.
</p>
<p>
An alternative to using Oracle's JDK you can also use openjdk which is developed by the community and
is compatible with Oracle JDK. There are differences which might cause an impact in production servers
but for development purposes openjdk should just be fine. Run the following command to run openjdk
from the terminal.
</p>
<pre>
alps install openjdk
</pre>
<p>
The buildscript for openjdk installs openjdk in /opt and also sets the PATH and JAVA_HOME variables
so you do not have to worry about them. To make the changes take effect, please restart the system.
In case you would not be able to restart the system immediately you can run the following command
from the terminal temporarily for it to recognize openjdk:
</p>
<pre>
source /etc/profile
</pre>

<h4>Installing maven</h4>
<p>
Maven is a build tool that Java developers should be familiar with. It makes the complex process
of building and packaging Java applications and dependency management very easy. Here is the
command to install maven:
</p>
<pre>
alps install maven
</pre>
<p>
If while run the mvn command, you get command not found. Run the following command:
</p>
<pre>
source /etc/profile
</pre>

<h4>Installing Eclipse IDE</h4>
<p>
If you are doing Java development, you might need the Eclipse IDE as well. In order to install the
Eclipse IDE, download it from their website - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a>.
Then open up the <b style="color: #ff0000">Binary Application Installer</b> from the Applications -> Systems menu, click the browse
button and point to the eclipse Binary just downloaded and click the Install button. Eclipse needs
Java to run so please install openjdk first.

<h4>Installing MariaDB</h4>
<p>
While doing java development one might need a backend database management system to store data. While
there are plenty of database management systems that Java can be used with a very popular database
that is used with Java is MySQL. Once again MySQL is also a property of Oracle but the community built
mariadb can be used as a drop in replacement for MySQL. Use the following command to install mariadb:
</p>
<pre>
alps install mariadb
</pre>
<div style="text-align: right"><a href="#top">Top</a></div>
