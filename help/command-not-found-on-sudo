<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
The sudo command gives superuser rights to the present user to execute any commands that follow the sudo command.
For instance to run the fdisk -l superuser privileges are needed. This command cannot be run by a normal user. In
order to run this command as root, one needs to prefix sudo with the command. So this command becomes: sudo fdisk -l

<h4>The Cause</h4>
<p>
In AryaLinux sometimes, Command not found error occurs when you run a command using sudo. This happens for applications
that are not installed in the regular /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin paths. For example when you install
openjdk or nodejs, it gets installed in /opt. In such a situation if you were to run let's say the npm command using sudo,
it would fail in AryaLinux. For example the following command would fail:
</p>
<pre>
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
</pre>
<div style="text-align: right"><a href="#top">Top</a></div>

<h4>The Solution</h4>
<p>
In order to make such commands work, you need to pass the -i option to sudo. So the above example would become:
</p>
<pre>
sudo -i npm install -g angular/cli
</pre>
<div style="text-align: right"><a href="#top">Top</a></div>
