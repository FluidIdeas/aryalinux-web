<h4>Using alps for app/package installation</h4>
<p>
If an application is present in AryaLinux repositories, then it can be installed using
alps. Alps downloads source code in the form of tar archives or by cloning git repositories,
builds and installs the package. Before installing any package, alps figures out the
dependencies of the package and the dependencies of the dependencies till it builds a
complete dependency chain. Then all the packages in the dependency chain are installed
in the right order.
</p>
<p>
The following command is used to install packages using alps:
</p>
<pre>
alps install package_name
</pre>

<h4>Installing applications using flatpak</h4>
<p>
If an application is not present in AryaLinux repositories then one can see if its is
present in Flathub and install if present. Flatpak itself can be installed using the
following command:
</p>
<pre>
alps install flatpak
</pre>
<p>
Packages in the Flathub are identified by their IDs. You can access Flathub using the
browser and search for the application and alongwith other details of the package, ID
would also be displayed in Flathub. Once you have ID for a Flatpak application you can
run the following command:
</p>
<pre>
flatpak install org.libreoffice.LibreOffice
</pre>
<div style="text-align: right"><a href="#top">Top</a></div>

<h4>Installing packages using docker</h4>
<p>
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by
using containers. Using docker containers one can install a wide varierty of applications
ranging from programming languages to platforms to tools and server applications and
minimal OS images. You can see the whole list of applications present in docker by visiting
the <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>. Docker can be installed using the
following alps command:
</p>
<pre>
alps install docker
</pre>
<p>
One thing to keep in mind is that similar to few other applications in AryaLinux,
docker is installed by downloading docker binary files and not built from source
code.
