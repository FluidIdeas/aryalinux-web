<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
AryaLinux is a GNU/Linux system that is built from source. The various source
tarballs are downloaded and built and installed in an empty partition to
in a pre-defined sequence to incrementally build the final system. Anyone can
build the entire system from scratch by following the instructions presented
below. This process can be used to generate a GNU/Linux distribution similar
to AryaLinux. Please note that the process of building the entire system is
very resource intensive and would require massive amount of computing power,
few gigs of data to be downloaded from the internet and anything ranging from
a few hours to a few days for the build process to complete. So having a
system with sufficient power and a fast internet connection is the key to
a successful build.
</p>
<p>
The whole process is automated so you might not learn a lot about the whole
process because most of the time its the system that would be doing the job
with very little intervention from your side unless an error occurs. Also
this process is not meant for advanced users and if you have the slightest
doubt about what is happening please do not attempt because a failed build
may result in a dead system or might put strain on your hardware as well.

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<p>
The best way to build AryaLinux is using the AryaLinux Live ISO but you can
also use an existing Linux distribution to do the same. The only impediment
would be few pre-requisites that the system has to meet before the build
process can start. Please take a look at the <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/systemd/chapter02/hostreqs.html">following page</a>
to learn more about the pre-requisites. Once you are done installing the
required tools and software in the host system, you can get started with the
build process. Please note that the AryaLinux Live ISO has all the prerequisites
pre-installed. So its the easiest way to build. If you are using AryaLinux
live ISO, then please prepare a Live Media out of the downloaded ISO
and boot into it.

<h4>Downloading build scripts and starting build</h4>
<p>
At this point it is assumed that you have either boot into the AryaLinux Live
Media or have installed all the required software in your Linux distribution
by following the link mentioned above. Go ahead and enter the commands given
below to get started:
</p>
<pre>
sudo su
cd ~
git clone https://bitbucket.org/chandrakantsingh/aryaLinux
cd aryalinux/base-system
./download-sources.sh && ./additional-downloads.sh
./build-arya
</pre>
<p>
This would download the required files into the /root/sources and then ask you
a series of questions after which the build process would start. Here are the
questions you would be asked with their significance:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Bootloader Device: The bootloader device is the device which has the partition
where you would like to build your system. For instance if you want your final
system to be present on /dev/sda10 then /dev/sda is the device name.
</li>
<li>
Root Partition: The root partition is the name of the partition where you want
the newly built system to exist. The root partition is the only mandatory
partition whose name is required for a successful install. You need to make sure
that this partition exists before the build process starts. In case you dont have
this partition, please go ahead and use fdisk to create the partition before
starting the installation once again.
</li>
<li>
Home Partition: The partition that would be mounted on /home. This is not mandatory
and if you are entering a value here, it must be different from the root partition.
If you are'nt sure simply press enter.
</li>
<li>
Format Home Partition: If you have'nt given a home partition name then enter n for this
option and if you have given a home partition then enter y or n depending on whether
you want the partition to be formatted. If you are'nt sure enter n.
</li>
<li>
Swap Partition: If your system has RAM less than 2GB then you need to have a swap partition
of size twice that of your RAM. Mention the swap partition's name here. If unsure press
enter
</li>
<li>
Locale: Enter your locale. For example de_DE.utf8 for german or fr_FR.utf8 for french.
</li>
<li>
OS Name: Enter any name for your OS. If unsure press enter. The resulting OS would be named
AryaLinux
</li>
<li>
OS Version: Enter 2.1 here.
</li>
<li>
Domain Name: Enter your domain name here. If unsure press enter.
</li>
<li>
Keyboard Layout: Enter the keyboard layout here. For example us for US-English or fr for French.
</li>
<li>
Printer Paper Size: A4 or Letter. Press enter if unsure.
</li>
<li>
Enter full name: Enter the full name of the default user. Press enter if unsure. If you press enter
the default user would be aryalinux.
</li>
<li>
Username: Enter the username for the default user. If unsure press enter. the resulting user would be
aryalinux.
</li>
<li>
Computer name: The name of the system. Press enter if unsure.
</li>
<li>
Use multiple cores for build: Enter y or n here. Its best to answer y here if you have a powerful
system and can take the build strain. Else enter n here.
</li>
<li>
Create backups: If you have given a sufficiently large partition for doing builds, then you may
enter y here. The system would be backed up at strategic points which can be restored to restart
the build process from that point rather than from scratch. Press enter if unsure or if your
build partition is small(less than 50GB size).
</li>
<li>
Install X Server: Press y if you want to install X Server. If you want to install a desktop
environment then you would need X Server. If you want to build a server system, you may choose n
here
</li>
<li>
Install Desktop Environment: If you want to install a desktop environment then enter y here else
enter n.
</li>
<li>
Desktop Environment: There are four desktop environments to choose from: XFCE, Mate, KDE and Gnome3.
Enter the number corresponding to the desktop environment from 1 to 4.
</li>
<li>
Install bootloader: If you want the Grub bootloader to be installed enter y here. If you are building
from within AryaLinux Live Media, you might want to answer y. If you already have some other Linux
distribution installed in the system you may want to choose n and update the Grub configuration of that
installation. Please do not forget to boot into that installation and run update-grub2(for ubuntu) or
grub-mkconfig for other distributions after the build completes so that Grub menu would present an
option for the newly built system.
</li>
<li>
Create Live ISO: Choose y here if you want to create a Live ISO file at the end of the build process.
The ISO file would be present in the /sources directory of the partition where you are building the
system.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Final output</h4>
<p>
If everything goes smooth, you would have the backups of the various stages in the /sources directory
of the partition where build is done. This directory would also contain the Live ISO file for the
system. The resulting system would have alps installed by default which you can use to install other
applications. You may as well install flatpak and docker to install other applications.

<h4>Issues</h4>
<p>
If you encounter any issues while running the build process, you can mail us at <a href="mailto:aryalinux11@gmail.com">
aryalinux11@gmail.com</a> and would try to help you. Please do not forget to mention the build system
details while contacting us like whether it is a physical system or virtual and the RAM, Hard Disk capacities etc.
